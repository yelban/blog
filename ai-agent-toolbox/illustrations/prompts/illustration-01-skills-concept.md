# Skills 概念轉換 - Conceptual Framework

STRUCTURE: Transformation flow (left to right)

LEFT SIDE - Before (Chaos):
- Scattered paper documents, sticky notes, SOP manuals
- Messy desk with overlapping files
- Speech bubbles with "怎麼做?" "問前輩" "找手冊"
- Frustrated human figure

CENTER - Transformation:
- Large curved arrow with sparkles
- Magic wand or transformation icon
- Label: "Skills 技能化"

RIGHT SIDE - After (Organized):
- Clean stacked skill blocks/modules
- Each block has icon: 報價、問答、請款、排程
- Friendly AI assistant character (robot with warm smile)
- Neat grid arrangement

RELATIONSHIPS: Chaos → Transform → Order, scattered knowledge becomes modular skills

- Left: Muted, slightly grey tones (problem state)
- Center: Golden yellow transformation glow
