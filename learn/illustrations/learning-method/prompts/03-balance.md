# Illustration: Balance of System Practice and Curiosity

## Visual Concept
A balanced scale showing both systematic practice and curiosity-driven exploration are needed.

## Center: Balance Scale
- Traditional balance scale design, perfectly balanced
- The fulcrum/pivot point: a happy child silhouette (arms spread wide)

## Left Side of Scale: "系統練習" (Systematic Practice)
- Error notebook / 錯題本
- Checklist with items checked off
- Calendar with study schedule
- Small robot helper icon
- Colors: organized blues and greens

## Right Side of Scale: "好奇心探索" (Curiosity Exploration)
- Magnifying glass
- Floating question marks
- Colorful butterflies
- Books with wings / flying books
- Stars and sparkles
- Colors: warm oranges and pinks

## Background
- Soft gradient sky
- The scale is in harmony - neither side is heavier
- Small decorative elements: clouds, stars

## Key Message Visual
- Both sides are equally important
- The child in the middle is the one who chooses when to use each

## Style Details
- Warm, inviting color palette
- Soft pastel tones with pops of color
- Hand-drawn feel, slightly imperfect lines
- Doodle-style decorative elements
- Friendly, encouraging mood
- Child-appropriate complexity
