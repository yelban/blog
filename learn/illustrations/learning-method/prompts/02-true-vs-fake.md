# Illustration: True Knowledge vs Fake Knowledge

## Visual Concept
Comparing traditional testing (only sees right/wrong) vs metacognitive approach (identifies true understanding).

## Left Side: "傳統方式" (Traditional Way)
- A test paper with checkmarks
- Some checkmarks have hidden question marks behind them (guessed correctly but don't really understand)
- Student looks happy but uncertain
- Surface-level success, hidden gaps

## Right Side: "新方式" (New Way)
- Same test paper but with two types of marks:
  - "確定 ✓" (Confident checkmark) - solid, bright
  - "不確定 ?" (Uncertain question mark) - highlighted for review
- Student looks thoughtful, self-aware
- Honest self-assessment

## Bottom Section
- A lightbulb icon with text concept: "知道自己不知道什麼"
- Small brain icon showing metacognition

## Composition
- Horizontal split or diagonal comparison
- Left: Warm but slightly murky colors (false confidence)
- Right: Clear, bright colors (true understanding)
- Icons: checkmarks, question marks, lightbulbs, thought bubbles

## Style Details
- Warm, friendly illustration style
- Child-appropriate cartoon characters (simplified)
- Soft edges, rounded shapes
- Encouraging tone - not judgmental
- Pastel color palette with accents
