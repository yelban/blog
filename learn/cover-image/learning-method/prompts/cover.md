# Cover Image Prompt

## Title
一個讓我變聰明的學習方法

## Visual Metaphor
A child standing at a crossroads with two paths:
- **Left path**: A structured garden with neat rows of labeled plants (representing systematic practice, error correction, organized learning)

The child holds a notebook in one hand and a magnifying glass (curiosity) in the other, looking excited to explore both paths.

## Composition
- Child figure in lower center, simplified/iconic style (no realistic face)
- Two diverging paths stretching toward the horizon
- Soft pastel sky with gentle clouds
- Small visual elements along each path:
  - Left: tiny checkmarks, sticky notes, a small robot helper
  - Right: books with wings, question marks floating, stars
- Title text overlay at top: "一個讓我變聰明的學習方法"

- Hand-drawn sketch quality with slightly imperfect lines
- Pastel color palette: soft pink, mint green, lavender, cream yellow
